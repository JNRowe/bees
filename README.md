# bees

Most recruiters suck. They don't actually read CVs, and when they do, they don't actually comprehend what's in them. They contact people over long dead projects and ignore real accomplishments. God forbid they somehow get hold of your phone number: then they'll call you at work and hassle you into giving up the job you rather like to take a job for less money working for someone you don't like.

And when you are looking for work, they aren't much better. They won't tell you what company they are recruiting for, they'll not tell you which area of the city the job is in, what the salary range is, what the technologies are, or why they are telling you about it. Sometimes they'll send you bizarre, ungrammatical emails telling you that you must take a job because there's a gay bar—the name of which they misspelled—on the same street (I wish to Cthulhu that was made up).

The bees project is an attempt to quantify exactly how clueless some recruiters can be. I place it on Github solely so I can see how long it takes until I get an email from a recruiter that makes reference to this codebase. `bees` is a honeypot for parasites.

The reference implementation of bees is in Python. Other programming languages will be added whenever I can be bothered. This code is for entertainment purposes only.
