# bees

Most recruiters suck. They don't actually read CVs, and when they do, they don't actually comprehend what's in them. They contact people over long dead projects and ignore real accomplishments. God forbid they somehow get hold of your phone number: then they'll call you at work and hassle you into giving up the job you rather like to take a job for less money working for someone you don't like.

The bees project is an attempt to quantify exactly how stupid some recruiters can be. I await an email from a recruiter telling me that they have a job for me based solely on the code in this repository. `bees` is a honeypot for parasites. If you aren't a parasite, this isn't for you.

The reference implementation of bees is in Python. Other programming languages will be added whenever I can be bothered.
